# Demonstrating-the-use-of-OneHotEncoder-and-ColumnTransformer-

OneHotEncoder and ColumTnransformer are two important classes in Python/Machine Learning's Scikit Learn library. 

OneHotEncoder is used to convert categorical data into numbers or 0, and 1 so that our machine learning models can understand and train on the dataset. 

Column Tansformer is used to implement the changes into the entire Dataset. 

In this section, you will find three files:

        a. "car-sales-extended_original_data": This file contains the original dataset that was available to us. This data set consists the data of a car dealership with 5 main columns: Make, Doors, Price, Odometer (KM), and Colour. 
        b. "demonstrating the use of OneHotEncoder to Convert Data into Numbers": This is the main python file that consists the code for demosntrating the use of OneHotEncoder and ColumnTransformer for implementing the necessary changes to the dataset. 
        c. "transformed_data": The transformed data dataset is the final dataset that I have extracted after implementing the necessary changes after implementing ONeHotEncoder and ColumnTRansformer
